This paper investigates the effectiveness of multi-agent large language model systems in collaborative medical decision-making scenarios, specifically focusing on challenging cancer cases that require multidisciplinary team consultation. We evaluate how different AI agents can simulate the roles of various medical specialists and collaborate to reach consensus decisions.

**Research Contributions:**
- Novel framework for multi-agent LLM collaboration in medical decision-making
- Comprehensive evaluation on challenging cancer case datasets  
- Analysis of agent interaction patterns and decision quality
- Insights into AI-assisted multidisciplinary medical consultations

**Keywords:** Multi-Agent Systems, Large Language Models, Medical AI, Cancer Diagnosis, Collaborative Decision-Making
