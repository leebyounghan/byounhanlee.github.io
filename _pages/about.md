I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Ajou University, advised by Prof. Kyung-Ah Sohn. My research focuses on building robust and safe AI systems, with particular emphasis on Natural Language Processing, AI Safety, and Medical AI applications.

## Research Interests
- **Robust AI**: Developing AI systems that perform reliably across diverse and challenging environments
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Investigating collaborative AI agents for complex decision-making tasks
- **Bias Mitigation**: Understanding and addressing societal biases in large language models
- **Explainable AI**: Creating transparent and interpretable AI systems for critical applications
- **AI Safety in NLP**: Ensuring safe deployment of language models in real-world scenarios

## Current Research
I am actively working on several research projects funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea:
- Robust Machine Learning for Low-Quality and Heterogeneous Text Data Environments
- Understanding and Mitigating Societal Biases Embedded in Large Language Models  
- Safe and Explainable AI Systems for Content Safety and Moderation

## News
- **2025**: Paper accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare (MLHC) 2025
- **2024**: Presented at Public Good Convergence Forum on LLMs and Human Collaboration
- **2023**: Paper published at EACL 2023 (Findings)

## Background
Before focusing on AI research, I completed dual degrees in Sociology and Applied Artificial Intelligence, which provides me with a unique interdisciplinary perspective on the societal implications of AI technologies.
